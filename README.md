# GUESS WHO GAME

Guess who is a game I've often played with my kids.
It usually requires two players, but in this case the player
is playing solo. From the outset I had a plan to make it a game
against the computer, but it turned out to be very complicated.

So the idea is that the player is going to ask questions about a hidden card
that is turned upside down over the board game. This hidden person is also 
a person on the players own game board. After each question about features
of the hidden person card, the players card with these choosen features get turned,
narrowing down the possible suspects.

For instance the player can ask, with radiobuttons, if the person is a 'man' - the hidden
person is a 'man' so all the woman on the player board get turned. Left is a smaller
pile of cards, the player can at anytime guess by hitting the guess button and point on 
one of the cards showing people. The player has one guess, then its game over.

## Game Functionality 

Unfortunatly I didÂ´nt get the game to function properly in time for submission.
The time to learn about manipulating arrays and different methods and functions to display
images etc across the DOM was not enough. I almost pulled it together and with a couple of days
I could make run as planned.
